# Why not AdBlock Plus?
They became corporate shills. Back in the early 2010s they implemented a feature called "Acceptable Ads" and allowed large corporations to pay them to allow their ads through. It was a way to support advertising as a business model without having to deal with the incredibly annoying stuff. Sounds great!...on paper. 

The reality is that all of this was (and still is) enabled on installations without the user's consent, much like how Khanmigo is forced on students regardless of whether they want to use it. Not to mention, basically saying "Hey, we're an adblocker, but we'll accept bribes to let your ads through!" is a pretty scummy practice if you ask me. 

It is worth noting that the Acceptable Ads program does allow small websites/advertisers to enter for free, so it wasn't entirely biased toward rich corpos. You can also disable "Acceptable Ads" in the main settings page of ABP if you wish.

There's also just the fact that they have a premium version -- and, as a matter of fact, give you ads for that as well if you don't also disable those, this time buried in the "Advanced" settings. Is it really ethical to push an adblocker then beg your users for money? Meanwhile, uBlock Origin is not only free and open source, but its developer, Gorhill, [won't even accept donations](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Why-don't-you-accept-donations%3F).
